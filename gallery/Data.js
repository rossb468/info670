  bio: "I began this photoblog in November 2007 to encourage myself to take photos on a regular basis. It has worked better than I hoped.\n\nTaking photos opens up the world to me, allowing me to see what's around me in new ways. Sometimes the new discovery is made as I take the photo, and sometimes when I see the photo on my monitor. This photoblog allows me to share these discoveries with you.\n\nMy goals are to continue to see the world better, become a more proficient photographer, share my photos with others, and enjoy the whole process. :-)"
